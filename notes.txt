When a move is made and it's successful the knowledge gained is
the asker, askee, and card. We must also learn that the asker
must have had a card in that set so their knownset must be updated
to include all cards in that set that aren't already in known. Those
must then also be removed from possible. The number of cards for the
asker should go up and for the askee go down. The known for the
asker should include the card taken.

When an unsuccessful move is made the knowledge gained is that
neither the asker nor askee has the card. We learn that the asker
has a card in that set so their knownset now includes everything
from that set that isn't that card. Remove those cards from possible.

If there is ever a single card from a set in knownset then it should
move to known.

If numCards is equal to length of known then knownset and possible 
should be cleared.

If numCards ever reaches zero then their knowledge should be completely
empty.

If a card is not in anyone's knowledge except for one person then that card
should be moved to known for that person.

There's a lot more like:
    - specific set hasn't been asked but players have known and knownset cards
    that make it impossible for them to have it so another person has it.
    - when 2 sets are left if it isn't known what the other team has but 
    their knownset does not include the other set then your team must have it
    and vice versa
    - if n number of cards of the same set are in knownset and they are known
      to have n cards of that set then those cards in knownset move to known 




Example Scenario:
 I have 2D and 7D and opponent has 4D and 5D but I don't know that
  -People have everything in possible
 I ask for 3D and get it wrong
  -People add low diamond set to knownset and remove 3D from possible
 I lose my 2D 
  -People remove 2D from possible and knownset and move other low diamonds to possible
 I get asked for 6D its wrong
  -People remove 6D from my possible
 I ask for 2D back
  -People move everything in possible to knownset (4D 5D 7D)
 I ask for 4D get right
  -People take 4D from knownset and possible and move to known
 I ask for 5D get right
  -People take 5D from knownset and possible and move to known
  -Since only 7D in knownset it gets added to known

Example Scenario 2:
 I have 2D and opponent has 3D 4D and 6D
 I ask for 3D and get right
  -People put 3D in known and move rest of low Diamond to knownset
 I ask for 4D and get right
  -People move 4D from knownset to known
 I ask for 7D and get wrong
  -People remove 7D from knownset and possible
 I lose my 3D
  -People remove 3D from known, knownset, and possible
 I lose my 4D
  -People remove 3D from known, knownset, and possible
 I get asked 5D and its wrong
  -People remove
 I take 3D
 I take 4D
 I take 6D

Based on these examples:
  When I lose a card that's in known. The other cards in that
  set get moved from knownset to possible.

Strategy:
  -Locking a dangerous player out
  -Going for a set that's close to completion
  -Asking less risky players (Like me asking Soumik instead of Meyan)
  -Utilizing limited repeat asks
  -Not leaking information about sets (minimizing other people's knowledge)
  -Playing long game

#list of players with set of cards in num format ex [{1,2,3},{23,45,25}]
#2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
#15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27
#28, etc basically +13 for next suit

# 6 * 2 * 4 = 48
# even factors of 48 are 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24

# playGame will first randomly pick a starting Player
# then it will call makeMove for that player
# once makeMove is called, update will be called on all
# players. a move can be two things, a call or an ask. 
# an ask will be defined as Asker, Askee, and Card. a call 
# is more complicated. a call will be defined as a series
# of asks to first opponents and then teammates. if a call
# is correct the scores will change accordingly

#assumptions:
#all players start with equal number of cards
#team distributions are balanced
#only 2 teams

#ideas for strats
#want to make a move for a card with the least guessing and
#choose the person with the highest chance of having it
#this should make it so it mostly goes for 1 card at a time

Calculating Probability:

Let's take a look at a simpler example. Let's say there are only 4 players and 4 sets with 4 cards.
1, 2, 3, 4 of H, S, C, D.

Example Scenario:
 I have 1H, 2H, 3H, and 1D.
 At the start of the game the chance someone has 4H is 1/3 because there are 3 players that are not me.
 If someone asks for a Heart then I know they have the 4H so the probability becomes 1.

 I have 1H, 2H, and 1D, 2D.
 The chance someone has the 4H is still 1/3. If an opponent asks for 1H what would the probability be?
 Well they must have either the 3H or 4H so it's a 50% chance they have it. 
 The scenarios are (I'm team 1):
  -Opp1 has 3H; Opp2 has 4H
  -Opp1 has 3H; Team2 has 4H
  -Opp1 has 4H; Opp2 has 3H
  -Opp1 has 4H; Team2 has 3H
  -Opp1 has 3H, 4H

This means the chance Opp1 has 3H or 4H is 3/5. The chance someone else has 4H or 3H is 1/5.
Lets say in another example I only have 1H. Opp1 asks my Team2 for 1H.
 The scenarios are (I'm Team1):
  3x of this just swapping around cards
  -Opp1 has 2H; Opp2 has 3H, 4H
  -Opp1 has 2H; Team2 has 3H, 4H
  -Opp1 has 2H; Opp2 has 3H; Team2 has 4H
  -Opp1 has 2H; Team2 has 3H; Opp2 has 4H
  3x of this just swapping around cards
  -Opp1 has 2H, 3H; Opp2 has 4H
  -Opp1 has 2H, 3H; Team2 has 4H
  1x of this
  -Opp1 has 2H, 3H, 4H

There are a total of 19 scenarios. The chance Opp1 has 2H, 3H, or 4H is (4 + 4 + 1)/19 or 9/19.
The chance someone else has a specific heart is (4 + 1)/19 or 5/19.

Lets say instead there are 5 Cards in a set and that I have the 1H 2H and 3H. Opp1 asks Team2 for 1H
  2x of this
  -Opp1 has 4H, Opp2 has 5H
  -Opp1 has 4H, Team2 has 5H
  1x of this
  -Opp1 has 4H, 5H

Even though the number of cards in the set increased, since we only care about whats left, the
probability didn't change. So in this case it's 3/5

Lets instead say there are 6 Players and 4 cards in a set. I have the 1H and 2H. Opp1 asks Team1 for 1H.
  2x of this
  -Opp1 has 3H; Opp2 has 4H
  -Opp1 has 3H; Opp3 has 4H
  -Opp1 has 3H; Team2 has 4H
  -Opp1 has 3H; Team3 has 4H
  1x of this
  -Opp1 has 3H and 4H
In this example the probability Opp1 has a specific heart is 5/9. The chance that another person has one is 1/9.

Lets instead say there are 6 Players and 4 cards in a set. I have the 1H. Opp1 asks for 1H to Team1.
  3 * 2x of this
  -Opp1 has 2H; Opp2 has 3H; Opp3 has 4H
  -Opp1 has 2H; Opp2 has 3H; Team2 has 4H
  -Opp1 has 2H; Opp2 has 3H; Team3 has 4H
  3 * 4x of this
  -Opp1 has 2H; Opp2 has 3H, 4H
  3 * 4x of this
  -Opp1 has 2H, 3H; Opp2 has 4H
  1x of this
  -Opp1 has 2H, 3H, 4H

In this case the chance Opp1 has a specific heart is (2*3 + 4 + 4*2 + 1)/(18 + 12 + 12  + 1) = (19/43)
The chance someone else has another specific heart is (3 + 1 + 2 + 1)/43 = (6/43)



Guess for formula:
 The chance someone has something when they asked for a card in the set is equal to
 wrong: ((number of cards left in set)*(# of players - 1) + 1)
 KnownSet:
  4 Player: 1, 3/5, 9/19
  6 Player: 1, 5/9, 19/43
 Possible:
  4 Player: 0, 1/5, 5/19
  6 Player: 0, 1/9, 6/43

Failed Knowledge Case: 
  Player 0: 7H 2C 4C KH 10C 7D 2H 5H
  Player 1: 3C JH QH JC 9S JS 5D KD
  Player 2: 9H 5C 2S 3S 4S 4D 9D QD
  Player 3: 7C 9C 6S 2D 3D QS KS 4H
  Player 4: 6H 10H AH QC 6D AS AD 3H
  Player 5: 6C 5S KC 7S AC 10S 10D JD
