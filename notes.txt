When a move is made and it's successful the knowledge gained is
the asker, askee, and card. We must also learn that the asker
must have had a card in that set so their knownset must be updated
to include all cards in that set that aren't already in known. Those
must then also be removed from possible. The number of cards for the
asker should go up and for the askee go down. The known for the
asker should include the card taken.

When an unsuccessful move is made the knowledge gained is that
neither the asker nor askee has the card. We learn that the asker
has a card in that set so their knownset now includes everything
from that set that isn't that card. Remove those cards from possible.

If there is ever a single card from a set in knownset then it should
move to known.

If numCards is equal to length of known then knownset and possible 
should be cleared.

If numCards ever reaches zero then their knowledge should be completely
empty.

If a card is not in anyone's knowledge except for one person then that card
should be moved to known for that person.

There's a lot more like:
    - specific set hasn't been asked but players have known and knownset cards
    that make it impossible for them to have it so another person has it.
    - when 2 sets are left if it isn't known what the other team has but 
    their knownset does not include the other set then your team must have it
    and vice versa
    -
